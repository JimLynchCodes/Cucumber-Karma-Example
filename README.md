# Cucumber Karma Example
An AngularJS example that uses "cucumberized unit tests" with the cucumber-karma-js project.

## Run Karma-Cucumber Tests
`./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start karma.copy.c.conf.js`

Scaffolded with the good ole' Gulp-Angular generator and ES5 JavaScript, this is meant to be a bare bones Angular application that is set up with cucumber-karma-js.
